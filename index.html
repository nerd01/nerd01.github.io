								<p align="justify"><b>Center for South Caucasus-South Asia Business Development</b> (aka </b>Caucasus-Asia Center</b>) is a non-partisan, non-profit body working in the direction of promoting the broad Caucasus region at the world-stage. It enables and empowers its engaging partners/ clients, comprising of private companies, public sector agencies, individual entrepreneurs, community associations and others, to generate fair profits in pursuit of their respective ventures. It works in the direction of linking businesses in different sectors, such as infrastructure,  education, healthcare, renewable energy/ power and financial services., between countries in South Caucasus and from across Asia.</p>
                                                                <p align="justify">The Center is a pioneering initiative of few individuals, stationed in different countries around the world, who are deeply knowledgeable about the prevailing business and socio-political environment in the Caucasus countries. It is started with a purpose of rebuilding the historic trade and people-to-people links between the two adjacent regions in Asia, i.e. South Caucasus and South Asia, in tune with the needs and opportunities in the 21st century. The Center maintains friendly relationship with various government and government supported bodies in the countries it functions. It endeavours to rightly leverage these connections for developing businesses for its engaging private sector partners. In the process, it continually evolves as a "one-stop business interface" for market entry and expansion in the Caucasus.</p>
